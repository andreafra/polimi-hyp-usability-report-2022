    H1 & 1 & Bread crumps are poorly used,and sometimes they show an incorrect path. Furthermore the search bar does not show any visual representation in the progression of searching & Homepage\\ \midrule
    H2 & 2 & Labels for section are brief but
    descriptive, easy to understand
    for the user (e.g. arriving and
    getting around, fly to Milan)
    Visual representations for specific
    sections are quite effective (e.g.
    showing pictures of art exhibitions
    as thumbnail for the art section in
    home, picture of a student for
    the study section in home), but
    some of them make no sense
    (e.g picture of a random
    building for the covid page) & Homepage, FAQ covid, Travel-info \\ \midrule
    H3 & 1 & Many pages have at the top
    some anchors leading to different
    sections of the same page,
    but users are not able to return to
    the top after clicking on any of the
    anchors, they have to scroll
    all the way back up
    Links leading to external sites
    don't have a warning saying that the
    user is leaving the site, nor it gets
    opened in a different tab
    Finally, due to their bad usage, bread
    crumps are not helpful in undoing the
    navigation (e.g. going through the
    navigation path backwards), so the user
    must rely on going back home or the
    "back" button of the browser & FAQ covid, Rents, Universities, 2-days Milano\\ \midrule
    H4 & 2 & The "+" most of the time works as intended,
    expanding the section, but
    occasionaly leads to a new page
    (e.g. in home). Furthermore sometimes
    the "-" is used in order to compress,
    while other times its role is replaced by
    an "x" & Castello Sforzesco, Homepage, events-month, miart\\ \midrule
    H5 & 2 & Subscribing
    to the newsletter with a
    missing @ in the email will result
    in an error message with suggestion,
    but if the same error is done in the student
    registration form no error prevention
    message appears
    Furthermore, some old links lead to
    non-existent pages, should be deleted & Study \\ \midrule
    H6 & 3 & In the search form for the venues,
    restaurants and hotels suggestions
    are present for type of venue
    and location & Venues, restaurants, hotels\\ \midrule
    H7 & 2 & Landmarks and shortcuts through the
    top menu ease a lot the navigation,
    though some options that are present
    in the footer are missing in the header & \\ \midrule
    H8 & 2 & Overall good, but some information
    overload in the menu and in the
    anchors mentioned before
    Also transitions and animations
    are sometimes present (e.g. carousel
    scrolling, sections expansion
    through the "+", reaching an anchor)
    and other times
    missing (e.g. dropdown of top menu) & \\ \midrule
    H9 & 2 & An incorrect email in the newsletter
    subscription will show a message
    that does not help in the
    error resolution,
    but incorrect data in the student
    form will suggest how to solve the
    problems.
    On the other hand, trying to access a
    non-existent page will result
    in a nice error message & \\ \midrule
    H10 & 3 & Privacy policies are clear & Privacy policy

    & MN1 & 3 & Similar pages offer the same
    type of interactions (e.g. itineries
    are all structured with a list of events,
    all venues show similar info such as
    price, opening time, location...) & \\ \cmidrule{2-5} 
    & MN2 & 3 & The top menu is always visible,
    letting users to switch between
    groups whenever they want &\\ \cmidrule{2-5} 
    & MN3 & 2 & As said before with anchors, going
    backwards to some parts of the same topic
    requires the user to scroll all the way back up
    (e.g. rent) &\\ \cmidrule{2-5} 
    & MN4 & 2 & In rents if one clicks on "read more"
    of a section, the bread crumps does not show
    the general page for rents in order to go back.
    For venues, an user can easily navigate to
    other venues by going back to the "venues"
    form page showed in the bread crump.
    Additionally a section dedicated
    to nearby and similar venues (you may also like)
    is very helpful.
    A similar section is present in
    events' pages for upcoming events & Rents, Rents-tenancy, Castello Sforzesco, miart, Venues\\ \cmidrule{2-5} 
    & MN5 & 2 & The only useful landmark is the one
    that leads to the home page,
    more landmarks could be added &\\ \midrule
\textbf{Content}                       & MC1 & 1 & A lot of information overload in the menu
and in some page anchors: the main
features should be maintained on the top
menu while putting the others in the footer.
Even worse, another criticity is the
absence of a link leading to the venues
search page (a very important
interaction page) in the top menu, while
the same link is present in the footer only &  \\ \midrule
\multirow{5}{*}{\textbf{Presentation}} & MP1 & 3 & Contrast of colors with the text is well
done (mostly black on white, if text
on an image, the text is wrapped inside
a box) and the
text-size is appropriate & \\ \cmidrule{2-5} 
    & MP2 & 3 & Icons are sometimes inconsistent
    ("-" replaced by "x"),
    but overall a lot of icons and
    brief descriptive labels are used
    that are pretty clear and coherent
    in their functionality & \\ \cmidrule{2-5} 
    & MP3 & 2 & There are some inconsistencies
    in the labels ("read more", "find out more",
    "see how", "discover how"...),
    that are functionally the same
    but worded differently & Rents\\ \cmidrule{2-5} 
    & MP4 & 2 & Some horizontal lines could be more
    marked to separate some parts within
    the same page (e.g. in the list of events
    of the month) &\\ \cmidrule{2-5} 
    & MP5 & 3 & &
