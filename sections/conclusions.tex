\section{Conclusions}
\subsection{Comparison of results}
Both analyses showed that:\\
- Problem in spatial allocation of important links such as "all the venues", as a matter of fact many users did not find the before mentioned link and failed or partially completed the task S6-T6\\
- The search bar influences the visibility of system status, the page appears to be frozen and many users were frustrated and were waiting for a long time\\

Differences:
- Some users found a number of problems that the inspectors missed during the inspection, we did not expect the search bar so much utilized\\
- Inspectors noticed immediately the main menu\\
- Users ignored the anchor links in pages like "university page" and "renting page"
% Comparison of the results achieved using the 2 methods
% - Problems priority and Suggestions for redesign
% - (Optional: Personal observations on the whole work performed: what did you learn?)
\subsection{Suggestions for redesign}
- Expand the headers of main menu, show the "hamburger menu" only when window is small
- Include "all the venues" in the main menu
- The search bar should be faster
- The link anchors for example in "university page" and "renting" could be put in a side menu
- Improve the filtering method in some pages, for example in "attractions" and in "itineraries" a way to filter according to topics (e.g. art, education...) would be preferable
