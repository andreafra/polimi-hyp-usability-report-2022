    The goal of this Usability Report is to analyze the results of the usability evaluation of the website https://www.yesmilano.it/en using two different methods: inspection (performed by the group members) and user testing (performed by a third party that matched with a specific user profile).\newline \newline
    \indent For the inspection, we select together the main functionalities of the website and formulate several tasks according to them. From the tasks, we perform the analysis of the website according to Nielsen's and MiLe heuristics, producing scores and comments with screenshots of the problematic website sections.\newline \newline
    \indent For the user testing, we collect data directly from 20 possible final users among two different user profiles (students and tourists). The inspectors ask each user to partecipate in a test to perform a series of tasks. During the process, the inspector has to monitor and collect data, producing quantitative and qualitative indicators. The collected information is then measured with scores and organized in tables or graphs. \newline \newline
    \indent At the end of the study the results of the two different methodologies are combined and final conclusions about the usability properties of the website are explained, furthermore providing some potential fixes and improvements to enhance the user experience while browsing the website.
